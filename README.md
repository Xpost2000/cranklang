# CrankLang

This is a basic alternate C-syntax sort of language.

It supports most of the common features that make a language
usable, and additional features it implements on top of the
C-language include:

- Anonymous Functions
- Arrays as types
- Array Programming (first class array objects) (all component wise operations.)

The language is designed to transpile relatively easily to C, and
also includes an interpreter.
